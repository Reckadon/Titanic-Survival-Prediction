On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# seeing data files\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-23T07:05:29.115670Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-23T07:05:29.116135Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-23T07:05:29.127326Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-23T07:05:29.116093Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-23T07:05:29.125393Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv\n/kaggle/input/titanic/test.csv\n/kaggle/input/titanic/gender_submission.csv\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> #### Importing modules","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#ignore warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sklearn as sk\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib\n# Retina display\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-23T07:20:19.648680Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-23T07:20:19.649138Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-23T07:20:19.664374Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-23T07:20:19.649095Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-23T07:20:19.662975Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Using matplotlib backend: <object object at 0x786f70385f10>\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Loading Data and performing EDA","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"training_filename = '/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv'\ntrain_set = pd.read_csv(training_filename)\n\nplt.plot(train_set['PassengerId'], train_set['Fare'])\nplt.ion()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-23T07:23:42.366094Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-23T07:23:42.366606Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-23T07:23:42.444768Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-23T07:23:42.366558Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-23T07:23:42.443029Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"execution_count":14,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<contextlib.ExitStack at 0x786f1a0ca7a0>"},"metadata":{}}]}]}
